  This website / blog features some of my work, generative art, and a blog that I probably won't post on.
  Basically a glorified resume. Maybe I'll put some buzzwords in here to feed the algorithm. I use
  python, p5js, processing, and pen plotters to make art. It's all about iteration. For software, I do a
  lot of data analysis and data engineering, but my favorite is algorithms. I'm trying to solve 100 Euler problems.
